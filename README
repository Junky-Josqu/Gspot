Gspöt - a stateful GUI lib for LÖVE

Notes :
- Work on migrating docs to the wiki is nearing completion, but there may still be some undocumented features.
- See issues

Files :
- Gspot.lua : the lib's only required file
- main.lua : commented demo -- may contain invalid assertions, due to recent changes
- conf.lua : LÖVE config for demo
- img.png : example image
- /Gewter : a super awesome platform shooter, made using an outdated version of Gspot as a game engine. I haven't gotten around to updating yet.

Aims :
- easily implemented GUI elements for game menus and other interfaces
- flexibility
- visual consistency

What it does :
- range of one-line GUI elements, with default functionality and manipulation functions
- callbacks for a wide variety of events
- element grouping and relative positioning
- cascading element styles
- timed element-level update functions

Gspot is free to use under the Zlib/libpng license.
