Gspöt - a stateful GUI lib for LÖVE

Notes :
- Work on migrating docs to the wiki is ongoing.

Files :
- Gspot.lua : the lib's only required file
- main.lua : commented examples and quick ref -- may contain invalid assertions, due to recent changes
- conf.lua : LÖVE config
- img.png : example image
- /Gewter : a super awesome platform shooter, made using an outdated version of Gspot as a game engine. Note that this was quite hastily thrown together, so all kinds of bad practice can be learned here.

Aims :
- ease of use
- flexibility
- visual consistency

What it does :
- range of one-line GUI elements, with default functionality included
- custom callbacks for a variety or events
- element grouping and relative positioning
- cascading element styles
- element level update and keyrepeat

Gspot is free to use under the Zlib/libpng license.
