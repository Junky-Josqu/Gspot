Gspöt - a stateful GUI lib for LÖVE

Notes :
- Documentation is currently out of date, but demo code is commented, and should provide enough detail to get by. Wiki will be updates asap.

Files :
- Gspot.lua : the lib's only required file
- main.lua : commented demo

- img.png : example image

Aims :
- easily implemented GUI elements for games and menus
- flexibility
- visual consistency

What it does :
- range of one-line GUI elements, with default functionality and utility functions
- callbacks for a wide variety of events
- element grouping and relative positioning
- cascading element styles
- timed element-level update functions
